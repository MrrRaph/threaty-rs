# Threaty
## Author: [Raphael Dray](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphaeldray/)
Threaty is a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) library to perform 
[CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_threat_intelligence) 
more agreeably by interfacing with 2 APIs for now such as 
[Censys.io](https://censys.io/) and [Shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io/).

### Why this library ?
For now, unfortunately, 
there are no Rust library that can help to perform CTI using this language.

So, I decided to create this one I mainly approached its implementation to be
as easiest to use and to maintain/improve as possible.
